# Welcome

This Regex Tutorial will guide you through the process of validating the provided regular expression (regex) for email addresses. The featured regex in this tutorial is /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. The tutorial offers a detailed analysis of each part of the regex, making the validation process easily understandable. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a better grasp of how the regex operates to verify and ensure the input of a valid email address.
